      tie %NameTable, 'Graphics::ColorNames', 'X';

      my $rgbhex1 = $NameTable{'green'};    # returns '00ff00'
      my $rgbhex2 = tuple2hex( 0, 255, 0 ); # returns '00ff00'
      my @rgbtup  = hex2tuple( $rgbhex );   # returns (0, 255, 0)

DESCRIPTION
    This module defines RGB values for common color names. The intention is
    to (1) provide a common module that authors can use with other modules
    to specify colors; and (2) free module authors from having to "re-invent
    the wheel" whenever they decide to give the users the option of
    specifying a color by name rather than RGB value.

    A more detailed description with documentation can be found in the
    module's POD.
